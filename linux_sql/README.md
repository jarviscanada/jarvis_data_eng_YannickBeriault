# Linux Cluster Monitoring Agent
This project is under development. Since this project follows the GitFlow, the final work will be merged to the master branch after Team Code Team.

A note for later: date is in UTC. Check if that is the time to use.  
A script should be made to test arguments for both host_info.sh and host_usage.sh: some redundancy would be avoided.

Connecting to psql instance: psql -h localhost -U postgres -d host_agent
