# Yannick Bériault . Jarvis Consulting

The first thing that attracted me into computer science were databases. Their potential for organizing and making sense of any type of data, as well as the impressive elegance presented by good code, something that I discovered during my training, are still aspects of the field that are really stimulating to me. I obtained a Certificate in computer science and am working on obtaining a second, advanced Certificate (both constituted of 30 credits). I have been working as a translator for many years before transitioning into software development.

## Jarvis Projects

**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_YannickBeriault/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Implemented a monitoring agent that is used to automatically gather hardware as well as memory and CPU usage information on a system. It gathers usage info every minute, as long as the database instance is properly running. It was made using bash scripts and sql, on a virtual machine accessed through VNC viewer. It runs a PostgreSQL database inside a Docker container. It obtains its data using terminal commands, whose results it processes using a combination of simple bash commands like `grep`, `cut` and `sed`.

**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_YannickBeriault/tree/master/core_java)]:
      
  - JDBC App: Realized a very basic implementation of a program for entering customers into a database and retrieving info about them. The database is implemented using PostgreSQL running inside a Docker container and the program makes use of JDBC and the SQL Java libraries. Dependencies where managed using Maven and version control was done through git, with Github as central repository.
  - Grep App: Implemented a very simple version of the terminal command grep, taking as arguments a regex pattern, a root directory in which to search the files for lines containing the pattern, as well as the path to a file (pre-existing or not) in which to save the lines containing the pattern. The app uses the io and nio libraries, as well as the util.function.Predicate and util.regex libraries for matching lines, and the util.stream library to gain performance, readability and to be able to potentially process large amounts of data. It was developed using git and the IntelliJ IDE and can be launched from a jar file or from inside a docker container.


## Highlighted Projects
**ProjekRockola**: Developped a command line based audio-player (no GUI) with elaborate smart playlist management. I decided to develop this program since no program gave me quite the smart playlist management experience I was looking for. It is written in Java, using javafx and JDBC. It makes use of an elaborate MySQL database, hosted locally. I use it every day.

**Mainframe**: Put together a simple GUI interface to manage various aspects of my personnal discipline. It is written solely in Java and uses simple text files for data persistence. It is an old project that will need to be totally revamped, but it has proven to be quite dependable. I also use it every day.


## Professional Experiences

**Software Developer, Jarvis (2022-present)**: I am tasked to implement and develop various applications that give me the opportunity to hone my skills with the technologies and techniques I learned in my training. I use languages such as bash, java and SQL, technologies such as virtual machines, the IntelliJ IDEA, Vim, Docker, Git and PostgreSQL, and techniques such as Agile/scrum and Gitflow.

**Evaluator, Université du Québec à Montréal (2019-2021)**: I evaluated students' programs written in Java, C++ and assembly language. I also had to take the time to answer students' preoccupations and questions about their grades, being firm and understanding at the same time.

**Translator, Amazon Europe Core (2017-2022)**: I translate products descriptions and internal documentations from English to French. I was happy to go from being employed from time to time to have access to almost all the contracts I could want through rigorous work and good evaluations from the organisation. Having the capacity to work with minimal information and try to still deliver the most appropriate result is also a skill I developed with this employer.
