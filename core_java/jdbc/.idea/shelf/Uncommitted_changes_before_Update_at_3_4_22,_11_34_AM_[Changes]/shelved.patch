<+># Preferred name (Characters only)\nname: \"Yannick Bériault\"\n# Your GitHub repo root URL\ngithub_repo_root_url: https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_YannickBeriault\n\n# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.\n# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words\nssummary: The first thing that attracted me into computer science were databases. Their potential for\norganizing and making sense of any type of data, as well as the impressive elegance presented by\ngood code, something that I discovered during my training, are still aspects of the field that are\nreally stimulating to me. I obtained a Certificate in computer science and am working on obtaining a\nsecond, advanced Certificate (both constituted of 30 credits). I have been working as a translator\nfor many years before transitioning into software development.\n\n# Group your skills by level.\n# Your skills can be anything software related (e.g. language, frameworks, methodologies, software, etc.).\nskills:\n  # At least 5 skills\n  proficient:\n    - Java\n    - Linux/Bash\n    - RDBMS/SQL\n    - Agile/Scrum\n    - Git\n  # At least 5 skills\n  competent:\n    - JDBC\n    - Vim\n    - IntelliJ IDEA\n    - JavaScript\n    - HTML/CSS\n    - Assembly language\n    - Algorithmics and Mathematics for Computer Science\n  # At least 5 skills\n  familiar:\n    - C\n    - C++\n    - React\n    - PHP\n    - Laravel\n\t- Haskell\n\t- Various binary encodings \n\n# List of Jarvis projects\njarvis_projects:\n  - name: \"Cluster Monitor\"\n    git_url: \"/linux_sql\"\n    # The project description allows hiring managers to understand your project and technologies you used(e.g. programming languages, libraries, algorithms, hardware, tools, etc.).\n    # The project description must start with an action verb (https://bit.ly/3guO98u)\n    description: Implemented a monitoring agent that is used to automatically gather hardware as\n\twell as memory and CPU usage information on a system. It gathers usage info every minute, as\n\tlong as the database instance is properly running. It was made using bash scripts and sql, on a\n\tvirtual machine accessed through VNC viewer. It runs a PostgreSQL database inside a Docker\n\tcontainer. It obtains its data using terminal commands, whose results it processes using a combination of\n\tsimple bash commands like `grep`, `cut` and `sed`.\n  #- name: \"Core Java Apps\"\n  #  git_url: \"/core_java\"\n  #  description:\n  #    - \"Twitter App: Curabitur laoreet tristique leo, eget suscipit nisi.
