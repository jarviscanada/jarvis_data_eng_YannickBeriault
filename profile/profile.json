It gathers usage info every minute, as long as the database instance is properly running. It was made using bash scripts and sql, on a virtual machine accessed through VNC viewer. It runs a PostgreSQL database inside a Docker container. It obtains its data using terminal commands, whose results it processes using a combination of simple bash commands like `grep`, `cut` and `sed`.",

The database is implemented using PostgreSQL running inside a Docker container and the program makes use of JDBC and the SQL Java libraries. Dependencies where managed using Maven and version control was done through git, with Github as central repository.",
        "Grep App: Implemented a very simple version of the terminal command grep, taking as arguments a regex pattern, a root directory in which to search the files for lines containing the pattern, as well as the path to a file (pre-existing or not) in which to save the lines containing the pattern. The app uses the io and nio libraries, as well as the util.function.Predicate and util.regex libraries for matching lines, and the util.stream library to gain performance, readability and to be able to potentially process large amounts of data. It was developed using git and the IntelliJ IDE and can be launched from a jar file or from inside a docker container."

I have been working as a translator for many years before transitioning into software development."
