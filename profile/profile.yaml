# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
ssummary: The first thing that attracted me into computer science were databases. Their potential for
organizing and making sense of any type of data, as well as the impressive elegance presented by
good code, something that I discovered during my training, are still aspects of the field that are
really stimulating to me. I obtained a Certificate in computer science and am working on obtaining a
second, advanced certificate (both constituted of 30 credits). I have been working as a translator
for many years before transitioning into software development.

    description: Implementing a monitoring agent that is used to automatically gather hardware as
	well as memory and CPU usage information on a system. It gathers usage info every minute, as
	long the database instance is properly running. It was made using bash scripts and sql, on a
	virtual machine accessed through VNC viewer. It runs a PostgreSQL database inside a Docker
	container. It obtains its data using terminal commands that it processes using a combination of
	simple bash commands like `grep`, `cut` and `sed`.
