# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: The first thing that attracted me into computer science were databases. Their potential for organizing and making sense of any type of data, as well as the impressive elegance presented by good code, something that I discovered during my training, are still aspects of the field that are really stimulating to me. I obtained a Certificate in computer science and am working on obtaining a second, advanced Certificate (both constituted of 30 credits). I have been working as a translator for many years before transitioning into software development.

    description: Implemented a monitoring agent that is used to automatically gather hardware as well as memory and CPU usage information on a system. It gathers usage info every minute, as long as the database instance is properly running. It was made using bash scripts and sql, on a virtual machine accessed through VNC viewer. It runs a PostgreSQL database inside a Docker container. It obtains its data using terminal commands, whose results it processes using a combination of simple bash commands like `grep`, `cut` and `sed`.

    description: Developped a command line based audio-player (no GUI) with elaborate smart playlist management. I decided to develop this program since no program gave me quite the smart playlist management experience I was looking for. It is written in Java, using javafx and JDBC. It makes use of an elaborate MySQL database, hosted locally. I use it every day.
  - name: "Mainframe"
    description: Put together a simple GUI interface to manage various aspects of my personnal discipline. It is written solely in Java and uses simple text files for data persistence. It is an old project that will need to be totally revamped, but it has proven to be quite dependable. I also use it every day.
